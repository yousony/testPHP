### Mission ###

Your mission is to create a page whose link is **yourdomain/my-work**  
On this page, you will show a title and a table (see https://github.com/simplifia/simpli-sf3-test-interview/blob/master/simpli-sf3-test-interview-mockup.PNG) with the correct CSS.  
The page shows the sum of the 2 numbers. If the result number is a odd, you show 'Impair', if it's not you show 'Paire'  
The input data are available in *config.php* in *INPUT_DATA* parameter.  
We work Model-View-Controller pattern. The computation has tobe made in controller not in view.
Don't forget to add **pertinent test** to your code
